# Email Service Fix Guide - Password Reset Not Working

## üîç Problem Summary

The forgot password and admin reset password features were not sending emails because:

1. **`EMAIL_SERVICE_ENABLED` was not set to `true`** in Render environment variables
2. When disabled, the EmailService only logged to console and returned `true` (misleading success)
3. The system thought emails were sent, but they were only being logged

---

## ‚úÖ What We Fixed

### 1. **Robust Boolean Parsing** (`config.ts`)
- Now accepts: `"true"`, `"TRUE"`, `"1"`, `"yes"`, `"y"`, `"on"` (case-insensitive)
- Previously only accepted exactly `"true"`

### 2. **Proper Error Reporting** (`email.ts`)
- Now **throws an error** when email service is disabled
- No longer returns misleading `true` when disabled
- Frontend/API will properly report email failures

### 3. **Startup Logging** (`index.ts`)
- Shows email configuration on server startup
- Displays:
  - EMAIL_SERVICE_ENABLED status
  - EMAIL_USER, EMAIL_FROM
  - EMAIL_PASSWORD status (SET or NOT SET)
  - FRONTEND_URL

### 4. **Admin Test Endpoint** (`admin.ts`)
- New endpoint: `POST /api/admin/test-email`
- Instantly test email configuration without going through full reset flow
- Admin-only access

### 5. **Updated Documentation** (`.env.example`)
- Added email configuration examples
- Added FRONTEND_URL configuration

## üöÄ Deployment Steps for Render

### Step 1: Set Environment Variables in Render

1. Go to **Render Dashboard** ‚Üí **escashop-backend** ‚Üí **Environment**

2. Add/Update these environment variables:

   ```
   EMAIL_SERVICE_ENABLED = true
   EMAIL_USER = jefor16@gmail.com
   EMAIL_FROM = jefor16@gmail.com
   EMAIL_PASSWORD = your-gmail-app-password
   FRONTEND_URL = https://your-frontend-url.onrender.com
   ```

   **Important Notes:**
   - `EMAIL_PASSWORD` must be a **Gmail App Password**, NOT your regular Gmail password
   - Get App Password: Google Account ‚Üí Security ‚Üí 2-Step Verification ‚Üí App passwords
   - `FRONTEND_URL` should be your deployed frontend URL (for password reset links)

3. Click **Save Changes**

### Step 2: Deploy the Code Changes

1. **Commit and push your changes:**
   ```powershell
   git add .
   git commit -m "Fix: Enable email service for password reset functionality"
   git push origin main
   ```

2. **Trigger Manual Deploy in Render:**
   - Go to Render Dashboard ‚Üí escashop-backend
   - Click **Manual Deploy** ‚Üí **Clear build cache & deploy**
   - Wait for deployment to complete

### Step 3: Verify Configuration

1. **Check startup logs in Render:**
   - Go to **Logs** tab
   - Look for the email configuration section:
   ```
   ============================================================
   üìß EMAIL SERVICE CONFIGURATION
   ============================================================
   EMAIL_SERVICE_ENABLED: true
   EMAIL_USER: jefor16@gmail.com
   EMAIL_FROM: jefor16@gmail.com
   EMAIL_PASSWORD: ‚úÖ SET
   FRONTEND_URL: https://your-frontend-url.onrender.com
   ‚úÖ Email service is ENABLED - Emails will be sent
   ============================================================
   ```

2. **If you see `‚ùå NOT SET` or `Email service is DISABLED`:**
   - Double-check environment variables in Render
   - Make sure `EMAIL_SERVICE_ENABLED` is exactly `true` (lowercase)
   - Redeploy after fixing

## üß™ Testing

### Test 1: Admin Test Email Endpoint

Use this endpoint to quickly test email functionality:

```powershell
# Replace with your actual backend URL and admin token
$backendUrl = "https://escashop-backend.onrender.com"
$adminToken = "your-admin-jwt-token"

$headers = @{
    "Authorization" = "Bearer $adminToken"
    "Content-Type" = "application/json"
}

$body = @{
    email = "jefor16@gmail.com"
} | ConvertTo-Json

Invoke-RestMethod -Uri "$backendUrl/api/admin/test-email" -Method POST -Headers $headers -Body $body
```

**Expected Response:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Test email sent successfully to jefor16@gmail.com",
  "timestamp": "2025-10-15T06:51:00.000Z"
}
```

### Test 2: Forgot Password Flow

1. Go to your **frontend login page**
2. Click **"Forgot password?"**
3. Enter a test email address (e.g., `jefor16@gmail.com`)
4. Click **"Send Reset Link"**
5. Check your **email inbox** (and spam folder)
6. You should receive an email with subject: **"Password Reset Request - EscaShop Optical"**
7. Click the reset link and verify it works

**Watch Render logs during this test:**
```
üìß Attempting to send actual email...
Sending password reset email to: jefor16@gmail.com
‚úÖ Password reset email sent successfully to: jefor16@gmail.com
```

### Test 3: Admin Reset Password

1. Log in as **admin**
2. Go to **User Management**
3. Select a user
4. Click **"Reset Password"** action
5. User should receive the password reset email
6. Verify the email arrives and the link works

**Watch Render logs:**
```
Sending password reset email to: user@example.com
‚úÖ Password reset email sent successfully to: user@example.com
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Email service is disabled" error

**Cause:** `EMAIL_SERVICE_ENABLED` is not set to `true`

**Fix:**
1. Go to Render ‚Üí Environment variables
2. Set `EMAIL_SERVICE_ENABLED = true` (lowercase)
3. Save and redeploy

### Issue: "Failed to send email" / SMTP errors

**Possible causes:**

1. **Invalid Gmail App Password**
   - Generate a new App Password from Google Account settings
   - Update `EMAIL_PASSWORD` in Render

2. **Gmail blocking sign-in**
   - Check your Gmail security settings
   - Make sure 2-Step Verification is enabled
   - Create a new App Password

3. **SMTP connection timeout**
   - Check Render logs for detailed error messages
   - Verify network connectivity

### Issue: Email sent but not received

**Check:**
1. **Spam/Junk folder** - Gmail might filter it
2. **Email address spelling** - Verify correct email
3. **FRONTEND_URL configuration** - Check reset link is correct
4. **Gmail sending limits** - Google has daily sending limits

### Issue: Password reset link doesn't work

**Cause:** `FRONTEND_URL` is incorrect or missing

**Fix:**
1. Set `FRONTEND_URL` to your deployed frontend URL
2. Example: `https://escashop-frontend.onrender.com`
3. Redeploy backend
